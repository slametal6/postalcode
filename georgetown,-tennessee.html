            Georgetown is an unincorporated community at the junction of Bradley, Hamilton, and Meigs counties, Tennessee. The community is located along State Route 60 near its intersection with State Route 58.<br/><br/>The Bradley County portion of Georgetown is part of the Cleveland, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Hamilton County portion is part of the Chattanooga, TN–GA Metropolitan Statistical Area.<br/><br/>Georgetown is the place name associated with U.S. Postal Service zip code 37336. The Zip Code Tabulation Area for that zip code had a population of 5,337, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Georgetown is located along Tennessee State Route 60, along what was part of the main Northern Route of the Trail of Tears in 1838. According to tradition, the village was named for Cherokee trader George Fields, who owned a two-story log home and operated a trading post at the intersection of Georgetown Road and Francisco Road in the early 1800s. "An affluent merchant who operated a flatboat on the Hiwassee and Tennessee Rivers, he was also an enslaver and leader in tribal politics. His two-story log dwelling, known as the George House, bears the date of 1812." The "George House" burned and was dismantled in 2014. It is believed that George Fields was buried just east of where his home once stood.
