            The Election Commission of India (ECI) is a constitutional body established by the Constitution of the Republic of India empowered to conduct free and fair elections in the Republic of India. It is headed by a chief election commissioner and consists of two other election commissioners as constituent members.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Structure ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1950, the Election Commission of India was established as a single member body. As per The Election Commissioner Amendment Act, 1989, the commission was made a multi-member body headed by a chief election commissioner and two other election commissioners, who were appointed to the commission for the first time on 16 October 1989. On 1 January 1990, it reverted back to a single member body after the post of election commissioner was abolished, before being restored to the three member structure on 1 October 1993. The commission headed by the chief election commissioner and consisting of two other election commissioners is further assisted by directors general, principal secretaries, and secretaries. The chief election commissioner does not have overruling powers and any decision is taken by the opinion of the majority among the three. The commission is headquartered at Nirvachan Sadan in New Delhi.<br/><br/>At the states and union territories, the state election commission is assisted by the chief electoral officer of the state or union territory (CEO), who leads the election machinery in the states and union territories. At the district and constituency levels, election and related work is carried out by the district magistrate or collector (in their capacity as district election officers), electoral registration officers and returning officers.
