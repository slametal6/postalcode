            In Christmas folklore and legends, Santa's Workshop is the workshop where Santa Claus and his elves live and make the toys and presents given out at Christmas. The exact location of Santa's workshop varies depending upon local culture, however it is generally said to be somewhere around or on the North Pole. There are at least eight claimed locations for his workshop. For example, people in Canada send letters to Santa's Workshop at his North Pole location in Canada, with the unique postal code of "H0H 0H0", stylized as H0 H0 H0.  In the United States, the workshop is considered to be a sprawling commune located at the North Pole. Some people in the United Kingdom and Finland believe that Father Christmas' Workshop is located in Northern Finland in Korvatunturi, Lapland. In addition to housing the factory where toys are either manufactured or distributed by the elves, the complex also houses the residence of Santa, his wife, companions, and all of the reindeer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Santa Claus grottos and department stores ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the late 19th century, it became common during December in large shops or department stores to have a "cavern" in which an actor dressed up as Santa Claus would give gifts to people. Grottos can be large walk-through fantasy cavern-like areas incorporating animatronic characters, such as elves and pantomime characters. A concept devised by Liverpool-based retail entrepreneur David Lewis to attract customers to his department store, this tradition started in Britain in 1879 and then, from the 1890s onward, extended to Australian and American department stores.
