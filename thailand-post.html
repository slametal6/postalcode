            Thailand Post (THP) (Thai: ไปรษณีย์ไทย, RTGS: Praisani Thai), formerly part of the Communications Authority of Thailand until 2003, is a state enterprise that provides postal services in Thailand.<br/><br/>The Post and Telegraph Office was first established in 1883 by King Rama V.: 19  Its first post office was in a large building by the Chao Phraya River, on the north side of the Ong-Ang Canal. In 1898, by merging with the Telegraph Department, its name was changed to "Department of Mail and Telegraph". The department was abolished in 1977 and the country's mailing and telegraphing was assumed by the new government-owned company, "Communications Authority of Thailand" (CAT). In 2003, the government separated the communications authority into two companies, "Thailand Post" and "CAT Telecom".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Prior to the operation of Thailand Post, there was limited mail service, mainly for the royal family. Traditionally, messages between the government in Bangkok and provincial outposts had been carried by a herald or by fast boat. During the reign of King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910), the Ministry of Interior maintained a schedule which specified that messages between Bangkok and Nong Khai took 12 days, between Bangkok and Ubon Ratchathani, 12 days, and between Bangkok and Luang Prabang, 17 days outbound and 13 days inbound.: 18  Domestic mail traveled by messengers while international mail traveled by steamboat to post offices in nearby countries, such as the Straits Settlements.<br/><br/>The earliest recorded mail from Bangkok dates back to 1836 when American missionary Dan Beach Bradley sent a letter to his father in a stampless cover.
