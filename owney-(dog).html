            Owney (ca. 1887 – June 11, 1897) was a terrier mix adopted in the United States as a postal mascot by the Albany, New York, post office about 1888. The Albany mail professionals recommended the dog to their Railway Mail Service colleagues, and he became a nationwide mascot for nine years (1888–1897). He traveled over 140,000 miles throughout the 48 contiguous United States and around the world as a mascot of the Railway Post Office and the United States Postal Service. He was the subject of commemorative activities, including a 2011 U.S. postage stamp.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Story ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Unofficial mascot ===<br/><br/>Owney belonged to a clerk at the Albany post office who would often come with him to work.  Owney seemed to love the smell of the mail bags and would often sleep on them. The clerk quit the Albany post office but knew that Owney was happier there with the mail bags.<br/><br/>Owney continued to sleep on the bags and would ride on trains wherever they were taken. He was considered to be good luck by postal railway clerks, since no train he rode on was ever in a wreck.
