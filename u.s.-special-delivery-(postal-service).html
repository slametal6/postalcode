            U.S. Special Delivery was a postal service paid for with additional postage for urgent letters and postal packets which are delivered in less time than by standard or first class mail service. Its meaning is different and separate from express mail delivery service. Essentially it meant that a postal packet was delivered from a post office to the addressee immediately once it arrived at the post office responsible for delivering it, rather than waiting for the next regular delivery to the addressee.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origin ==<br/><br/>The U.S. Post Office in conjunction with the Universal Postal Union established a basis for a special service for speedier delivery of mail for an extra fee beginning in 1885. Special Delivery was at first limited to post offices that operated in townships with populations of 4,000 or more. In 1886 Congress revised Special Delivery service to all U.S. post offices. Special Delivery service was in operation from 1885 to 1997 whereby the letter would be dispatched immediately and directly from the receiving post office to the recipient rather than being put in mail for distribution on the regular delivery route.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Special Delivery stamps ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1885 Congress enacted the use of "a special stamp of the face valuation of ten cents ... [that] when attached to a letter, in addition to the lawful postage thereon ... shall be regarded as entitling such letter to immediate delivery." The first Special delivery stamp was printed by the American Bank Note Company and issued on October 1, 1885.
