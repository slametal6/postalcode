            In the law of the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification of the general and permanent regulations promulgated by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government of the United States. The CFR is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation.<br/><br/>The CFR annual edition is published as a special issue of the Federal Register by the Office of the Federal Register (part of the National Archives and Records Administration) and the Government Publishing Office. In addition to this annual edition, the CFR is published online on the Electronic CFR (eCFR) website, which is updated daily.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Congress frequently delegates authority to an executive branch agency to issue regulations to govern some sphere.  These statutes are called "authorizing statute" or "enabling statute" (or "authorizing legislation").  Authorizing statutes typically have two parts: (1) a substantive scope, typically using language such as "The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to [accomplish some purpose or within some scope]"; and (2) procedural requirements, typically to invoke rulemaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA, codified at 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501–3521), Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 601–612), and several executive orders (primarily Executive Order 12866)).  Generally, each of these laws requires a process that includes (a) publication of the proposed rules in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), (b) certain cost-benefit analyses, (c) request for public comment and participation in the decision-making, and (d) adoption and publication of the final rule, via the Federal Register. Rulemaking culminates in the inclusion of a regulation in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Such regulations are often referred to as "implementing regulations" vis-a-vis the authorizing statute.
