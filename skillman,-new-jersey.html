            Skillman is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Montgomery Township, in Somerset County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2010 United States Census, the CDP's population was 242.<br/><br/>The area is served as United States Postal Service ZIP Code 08558.  However, the Skillman postal address covers an area significantly larger than the Skillman CDP.  The Skillman postal address services approximately half of the 32 square miles (83 km2) and approximately 23,000 residents comprising Montgomery Township.  The small CDP designated as Skillman and the much larger area known as Skillman based on the post office delivery area (which encompasses the Skillman CDP), are not the same.<br/><br/>The Skillman postal area is home to Johnson &amp; Johnson's Consumer Products division and Bloomberg L.P. Financial's offices.<br/><br/>All of the public school buildings (elementary, middle and high schools) for Montgomery Township are located in the Skillman postal area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Skillman is named after the Skillman family. The first Skillmans were Dutch, but lived in England before moving to Brooklyn in 1664, according to family accounts. In 1729, Thomas Skillman ventured westward, buying some 500 acres (2.0 km2) of farmland on the Millstone River, near the village of Rocky Hill, for his sons, Jan and Isaac.
