            The Seychelles Postal Service, is the public operator responsible for postal service in Seychelles.<br/><br/>The Seychelles Postal Service is a member of the Universal Postal Union as accepted into the organization on 7 October 1977 using the ISO Code: ISO 3166-2:SC. It is a signatory to the 2016 Postal Payment Services Agreement.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Seychelles first post office was opened in 1861 though letters may have been carried privately since 1824. A central post office, as a sub-office of Mauritius, was opened in Victoria in 1861 but used Mauritius stamps, until 5 July 1880, when only Seychelles stamps were valid though Mauritius stamps could be exchanged for the new local stamps that were issued on 5 April 1890. Except for improvements and repairs the Victoria post office has remained in the same location since opening.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A regular maritime mail contract was initiated in 1866 and by 1877, 14,184 letters were reported between the Seychelles and the Mauritius Post Office. A local post was first initiated in 1893 and police non-commissioned officers acted as receiving and dispatching officers but this terminated in July of the following year. 1894 and 1895 saw great strides forward with the introduction of an inland postal service and the British India Steam Navigation Company starting a shipping contract in August 1895.<br/><br/>Bickham Sweet-Escott became administrator of the Seychelles in June 1899 and Governor of the Seychelles between 1903-4. During his tenure he introduced changes that improved the inland post service using the paquebot service.
