            Postal III is a third-person shooter video game developed by Trashmasters and Running with Scissors, and published by Akella. It was released for Microsoft Windows in December 2011 as the third game in the Postal series and sequel to Postal 2. The game follows series protagonist The Postal Dude who, after leaving Paradise in the previous entry's Apocalypse Weekend expansion pack, finds himself in the town of Catharsis, Arizona after running out of gas, and must find a way to escape. Ports for OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were announced, but ultimately canceled.<br/><br/>Originally, the game was intended as a sequel to Postal 2 but after significant backlash from critics and fans, Running With Scissors declared the game a spin-off and retconned it as non-canonical.<br/><br/>Despite the critical failure, the game was financially successful and brought considerable income to Akella.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Gameplay ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Postal III features a third-person, over-the-shoulder perspective, unlike Postal and its sequel, which featured a isometric and first-person perspective, respectively. The gameplay is much more linear and mission based, also unlike Postal 2, though an open-world game mode was later added in an update. The player, taking the role of The Postal Dude, uses various firearms and melee weapons to defeat enemies, with the option to attack them either lethally or non-lethally.<br/><br/>The game features a Karma system.
