            The Comstock Act of 1873 is a series of current provisions in Federal law that generally criminalize the involvement of the United States Postal Service, its officers, or a common carrier in conveying obscene matter, crime-inciting matter, or certain abortion-related matter. The Comstock Act is largely codified across title 18 of the United States Code and was enacted beginning in 1872 with the attachment of a rider to the Post Office Consolidation Act of 1872. Amended multiple times since initial enactment, most recently in 1996, the Act is nonetheless often associated with U.S. Postal Inspector and anti-vice activist Anthony Comstock.<br/><br/>The law was applied broadly for much of its history, before the scope of enforcement narrowed after various court rulings, and modern enforcement is primarily focused on prosecuting child pornography (with the most recent conviction under the Act being made in 2021). In spite of its contentious nature, something that has throughout the years spawned a variety of legal challenges on enumerated powers doctrine, vagueness doctrine, First Amendment grounds, and so forth, the Comstock Act has thus far been widely upheld as constitutional.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Text ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Preface ===<br/><br/>The majority of the Comstock Act is found in sections 1461 and 1462 of chapter 71, title 18 of the United States Code. The rest of chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, consists of various provisions from the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act of 1988 and the PROTECT Act of 2003.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 18 U.S.C. § 1461 ===<br/><br/>The first of the two sections of the Comstock Act which are contained under chapter 71, title 18, United States Code, is section 1461. This is the initial Comstock Act provision, as currently amended, and it was first enacted as a rider under Sec. 148 of the Post Office Consolidation Act of 1872.
