            McDonald is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Bradley County, Tennessee, United States. McDonald is located along U.S. Route 11 and U.S. Route 64 6.8 miles (10.9 km) west-southwest of Cleveland. McDonald has a post office with ZIP code 37353.<br/><br/>The United States Census Bureau treated the community as a CDP for the 2020 census and the population was 586.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The McDonald community was established circa 1850. The origin of its name is unclear; the community may have been named for a Scottish trader, a railroad builder, or the mother of a resident. In 1887, Goodspeed's History of Tennessee described McDonald's Station as a "small village on the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railroad." Many mineral springs are located in the McDonald area, and the community had many popular resorts from the 1880s to the 1930s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Horses ==<br/><br/>The Tri-State Exhibition Center, an arena for horse shows and other large events, is located in McDonald. The arena opened in 2001 and underwent a major expansion in 2003; the expansion was expected to be an economic boon for the area.<br/><br/>The Johnston family, of Coca-Cola Enterprises, has owned the 4,000-acre Bendabout Farm in McDonald since the 1830s.
