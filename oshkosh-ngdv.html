            The Oshkosh Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) is a mail truck for the United States Postal Service (USPS). The contract, which is valued at $6 billion, was awarded to Oshkosh Defense of the Oshkosh Corporation in February 2021. Up to 160,000 vehicles will be built in a new South Carolina factory. Four variants of the NGDV are expected to be in fleet use: both gasoline-powered and battery-electric, in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The USPS was scheduled to start receiving the vehicles October 2023, but repeated delays meant that only 93 vehicles had been delivered by December 2024.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>On January 20, 2015, the USPS issued a Request for Information (RFI) notice for a Next Generation Delivery Vehicle. On February 13, 2015, it was announced that General Motors would be bidding on the contract, which would include the construction of 180,000 new vehicles at a cost of at least $5 billion. The stated goal of the contract was to have the first vehicles on the road by 2018. Potential bidders had until March 5, 2015 to submit comments and pre-qualification responses. The USPS issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) to 15 prequalified companies on April 14, 2015; General Motors was not on the prequalified list.
