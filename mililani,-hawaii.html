            Mililani (Hawaiian pronunciation: [miliˈlɐni]) is a city located near the center of the island of Oʻahu in Honolulu County, Hawaiʻi, United States. It consists of two census-designated places, Mililani Town, with a population of 28,121 at the 2020 census, and Mililani Mauka, with a 2020 census population of 21,075.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mililani sits on former plantation fields owned by Castle &amp; Cooke, which began planning for its development in 1958 under its Oceanic Properties subsidiary. Castle &amp; Cooke's plan was to collaborate with planners and architects on making Mililani Town a satellite city that would satisfy Oʻahu's pent-up demand for housing with a new affordable community. It was planned to eventually support a population of 75,000 people. Architect and developer Al Boeke, who would later create the planned community of Sea Ranch, California, was the development director of Mililani. The first homes in Mililani went on sale on June 23, 1968.<br/><br/>In 1976, Interstate H-2 opened for Mililani, cutting travel time from Mililani to Honolulu in half. In 1986, Mililani was named an All-America City in recognition of a community effort to clean up drinking water contaminated with agricultural pesticides. It is the only community in Hawaiʻi ever to receive this distinction.
