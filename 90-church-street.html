            90 Church Street is a federal office building in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The building houses the United States Postal Service's Church Street Station, which is responsible for the 10007 ZIP Code. The building takes up a full block between Church Street and West Broadway and between Vesey and Barclay Streets.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>90 Church Street was designed by Cross &amp; Cross, Pennington, Lewis &amp; Mills and Louis A. Simon, who was Supervising Architect of the Department of the Treasury at the time. The architectural style of the building is a mixture of Neo-classicism and Art Deco. It has two towers and the facade is clad in limestone. The AIA Guide to New York City described the building as "a boring limestone monolith that has trouble deciding between a heritage of stripped down neo-Classical and a new breath of Art Deco."<br/><br/>The building was completed in 1935.<br/><br/>It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989.  The building was extensively renovated by Boston Properties, Inc from the early 1990s though 2000 by Architects Swanke Hayden Connell Architects and Brannen Associates.<br/><br/>In addition to housing the Postal Service, the 90 Church Street building contains offices of the New York State Public Service Commission, the New York State Health Department, and the New York City Housing Authority.
