            A balikbayan box (lit. 'repatriate box') is a corrugated box containing items sent by overseas Filipinos (known as balikbayan literally "returnee to the country/nation"). Though often shipped by freight forwarders specializing in sending balikbayan boxes by sea, such boxes are also commonly brought by Filipinos returning to the Philippines via air.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 1973, the government of then-President Ferdinand Marcos, Sr began encouraging Filipino Americans to visit their ancestral hometowns in the Philippines. Individuals who did so became known as balikbayan, from the Tagalog words balík, "to return", and bayan, "town/settlement". Under the program, customs procedures were eased for such travellers and it was expanded by subsequent administrations. <br/><br/>Returnees often had gifts for friends and family as a modern extension of the pasalubong tradition, where presents are handed to those at home upon arrival from a journey or some absence. This expresses appreciation for and improves relations with people in a place of origin for those who are seen as having achieved financial success abroad. For those returning with valid balikbayan status, customs fees were waived for the contents of two boxes per individual. Eventually, it became common to package gifts, often household goods and practical items, in a box while still abroad. These boxes would then be shipped to the Philippines.
