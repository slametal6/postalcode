            Postal notes were the specialized money order successors to the United States Department of the Treasury's postage and fractional currency. They were created so Americans could safely and inexpensively (for a three cent fee) send sums of money under $5 to distant places.<br/><br/>Postal Notes were privately produced by three different firms in six design types during three four-year contracts. Developed under Postmaster General Walter Q. Gresham, they were first issued at the nation's post offices on Monday, September 3, 1883. Numerous "first day" souvenir notes have survived.<br/><br/>Government officials, wary of the continuing problem of postal theft, initially mandated that the notes could be cashable only in the city named by the purchaser. Engraved and printed by the Homer Lee Bank Note Company, the first two designs (Types I and II) had a space for the postal clerk to indicate where the note was being sent. If stolen en route, the note had no value, as it could not be cashed in any other city. All Postal Notes were printed on a watermarked security paper produced by Crane &amp; Co. that features a unique watermark.
