            Oak Ridge is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in West Milford Township in Passaic County and Jefferson Township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The area is served as United States Postal Service ZIP Code 07438.<br/><br/>As of the 2020 United States census, the population was 10,996.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>The Oak Ridge CDP is located in northern Morris County and western Passaic County and includes several communities, including Oak Ridge proper in Passaic County on the Pequannock River along Route 23 and the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railroad main line. In Morris County, the communities of Milton, Petersburg, and Woodstock are within the Oak Ridge CDP. County Route 699 (Oak Ridge Road) runs south from the junction with Route 23 and is the main north–south local route in the community.<br/><br/>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Oak Ridge CDP has a total area of 14.26 square miles (36.9 km2), of which 13.31 square miles (34.5 km2) are land and 0.95 square miles (2.46 km2), or 6.65%, are water. The Pequannock River, forming the Passaic/Morris county line, takes a winding course through the northern part of the CDP, separating Oak Ridge proper from the communities of Milton and Petersburg. The Pequannock is an east-flowing tributary of the Pompton River and part of the Passaic River watershed. Oak Ridge Reservoir on the Pequannock lies on part of the northwest border of the CDP. A low height of land just south of the Pequannock River places the southern part of the CDP within the watershed of the Rockaway River, a south-flowing tributary that also leads to the Passaic. White Rock Lake, Mitt Pond, Moosepac Pond, Cozy Lake, Lake Swannanoa, and Oak Ridge lake are all within the CDP and drained by the Rockaway River.
