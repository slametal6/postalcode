            The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) or the Postal Act of 2006 is a United States federal statute enacted by the 109th United States Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 20, 2006. It was meant to overhaul the United States Postal Service (USPS) after a financial crisis affected the Service in 2001. It was the first major overhaul of the USPS since the Service became an independent agency in 1970.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 ===<br/><br/>In 1970, Richard Nixon signed the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 into law. This law transformed the United States Post Office Department into the modern United States Postal Service. This was in response to a growing deficit in the post-war years and a nationwide strike by postal workers.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2001 Postal Crisis ===<br/><br/>In 2001, an economic crisis was predicted for the Service that led Congressional leaders to hold hearings on what factors might cause a full blown crisis. These factors included falling revenue, falling mail volume due to competition, and increasing debt. When the crisis did hit, it was found that the lengthy rate setting process, higher personnel costs compared to competitors, and the increased usage of the internet all contributed to the crisis. The American Postal Workers Union (APWU) claimed that the $12 billion in annual discounts given to private mailers for pre-sorting mail was also to blame.
