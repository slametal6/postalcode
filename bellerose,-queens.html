While the northeastern section of Queens Village is sometimes referred to as part of Bellerose, it is also called Bellerose Manor, which is recognized by the U.S. Postal Service as an "acceptable alternate" to Queens Village and Jamaica in postal addresses.<br/><br/>Bellerose is located in Queens Community District 13 and its ZIP Code is 11426. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 105th Precinct.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Demographics ==<br/><br/>Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Bellerose was 25,287, an increase of 823 (3.4%) from the 24,464 counted in 2000.
