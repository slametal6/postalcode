            William Harrison Hays Sr. (; November 5, 1879 – March 7, 1954) was an American politician, and member of the Republican Party. As chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1918 to 1921, Hays managed the successful 1920 presidential campaign of Warren G. Harding. Harding then appointed Hays to his cabinet as his first Postmaster General. He resigned from the cabinet in 1922 to become the first chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America. As chairman, Hays oversaw the promulgation of the Motion Picture Production Code (informally known as the Hays Code), which spelled out a set of moral guidelines for the self-censorship of content in American cinema.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>William Harrison Hays Sr. was born November 5, 1879, in Sullivan, Indiana, to Presbyterians John Tennyson and Mary (née Cain) Hays. The family's origins lay within various regions of the British Isles, one of which was Isle of Man, from which his maternal side had came. He recounted his home as having been "religious"—although "in no sense puritanical or severe"—providing "spiritual 'air conditioning' in which it was a joy to live." He was close to his maternal grandparents, William Henry and Nancy Duncan, whose lives extended to his years in college.
