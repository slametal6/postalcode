            The National Postal Museum, located in Washington, D.C., is the primary postal museum of the United States. It covers large portions of the postal history of the United States and other countries. It was established through joint agreement between the United States Postal Service and the Smithsonian Institution and opened in 1993.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Premises ==<br/><br/>The museum is located in the building that served as the main post office of Washington, D.C. for decades, from its construction in 1914 until 1986. The building was designed by the Graham and Burnham architectural firm, which was led by Ernest Graham following the death of Daniel Burnham in 1912. The headquarters of the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics is based in this building, and there is also space for a data center for the United States Senate. It is located across the street from Washington Union Station.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Displays ==<br/><br/>The museum's atrium features vehicles used to deliver mail throughout the history of the USPS, including planes, trains and automobiles. Historical exhibits guide visitors through the postal service's inception and expansion, as well as its role in significant national events such as World War II. "Systems at Work" explores historic and current technologies involved in mail processing and delivery, such as message boxes, ZIP codes, optical scanners and conveyor systems. <br/><br/>The museum holds the National Philatelic Collection.
